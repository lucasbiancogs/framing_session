# Phase 0 — Mental Model & Realtime Taxonomy

## Context (Standalone)

You are starting with zero Supabase code.
This phase is about understanding what tools exist and why.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between:
  - Database realtime (CDC)
  - Presence
  - Broadcast
- Know which problems each tool solves
- Avoid common misuse early

## Concepts Covered

- Source of truth vs transient state
- Why realtime ≠ syncing everything
- Whiteboard as a distributed system

## What Is Done (By Assistant)

- Written explanations only
- Diagrams or flows in markdown
- Mental model documentation

## What Is NOT Done

- No Flutter code
- No Supabase project creation
- No SQL

## Files That May Be Touched

- `README.md`
- `supabase/notes/concepts.md`

## TODOs (For User)

- [ ] Write a one-paragraph explanation for each realtime tool
- [ ] Decide which tool fits:
  - Shape creation → ?
  - Cursor movement → ?
  - User list → ?
- [ ] Draw your own data flow diagram
