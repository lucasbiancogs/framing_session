# Phase 1 — Project & Environment Setup

## Context (Standalone)

Assume:
- No Supabase project exists
- No Flutter project exists

## Learning Goals

- Understand how Flutter and Supabase connect
- Learn environment variable handling
- Avoid setup-level mistakes

## What Is Done (By Assistant)

- Flutter project initialized
- Supabase project created (instructions)
- Supabase Flutter SDK added
- Environment variables explained

## What Is NOT Done

- No database tables
- No realtime subscriptions
- No UI logic tied to Supabase

## Files That May Be Touched

- `flutter/` — Project initialization
- `flutter/README.md`
- `supabase/README.md`

## Key Concepts

### Environment Variables

```dart
// Never hardcode in production
final supabase = Supabase.initialize(
  url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
  anonKey: 'YOUR_ANON_KEY',
);
```

### Why Anon Key Is Dangerous

The anon key is public and embedded in client apps. Without Row Level Security (RLS), anyone with this key can read/write your entire database.

## TODOs (For User)

- [ ] Verify Supabase client initializes
- [ ] Break setup intentionally and fix it
- [ ] Explain why anon key is dangerous in prod
